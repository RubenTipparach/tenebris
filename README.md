# Tenebris

## Current Status

- Fully destructible voxel environment
- 2 celestial objects you can jump from one to the other seamlessly
- Multi-threaded JavaScript (lol)
- Working FPS physics: water, gravity, collisions, caves and arch structures just work
- Realtime LOD loading, some hitches but very playable at the moment
- Lazy calculated indirect lighting (don't look at it too hard) but it works enough to make me happy

## What's Next?

- Mining resources
- Crafting/tech tree
- Building rockets, you won't have access to that sweet interplanetary jetpack in the real game
- Local walkable grid system (for spaceships)
- Fauna and flora
- Fishing, hunting and farming, these can be used in tech trees too
- Light sources like torches and stuff
- Persistence
- .....networking.....?
