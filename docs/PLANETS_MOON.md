# The Moon - Earth's Companion

## Overview
The Moon is the first destination for interplanetary travel. A barren, airless world with valuable resources not found on Earth. The low gravity and lack of atmosphere present unique challenges and opportunities.

**Radius:** 30 units
**Gravity:** 0.16x (bouncy movement)
**Atmosphere:** None (space suit required)
**Day/Night Cycle:** Yes (very long - 14 Earth days each)
**Water:** None on surface (ice in craters)

---

## Environment

### Hazards
- **No Atmosphere:** Space suit required at all times. Suit damage = death
- **Extreme Temperatures:** Scorching in sunlight, freezing in shadow
- **Micrometeorites:** Occasional random damage to exposed surfaces
- **Long Nights:** 14 day-cycles of darkness, need light sources

### Benefits
- **Low Gravity:** Jump 6x higher, fall damage reduced
- **No Weather:** Always clear "skies"
- **Rich Deposits:** Surface minerals easy to find
- **Helium-3:** Unique fusion fuel

## Terrain Features

### Mare (Lunar Seas)
- Flat, dark basalt plains
- Easy to traverse
- Rich in titanium and iron
- Good landing zones

### Highlands
- Bright, heavily cratered terrain
- Older rock formations
- Aluminum-rich deposits
- Difficult navigation

### Craters
- Impact formations of various sizes
- Deep craters have permanent shadow
- Ice deposits in shadowed regions
- Some contain rare minerals

### Rilles
- Ancient lava tube collapses
- Long, winding channels
- Shelter from radiation
- Hidden cave systems

### Lava Tubes
- Underground tunnels from ancient volcanism
- Natural shelter from radiation and temperature
- Potential base locations
- May contain crystal formations

## Challenges & Gameplay

### Survival Priorities
1. **Oxygen** - Suit has 10 minute supply, need O2 generators
2. **Power** - Everything needs electricity
3. **Temperature** - Shelter from extremes
4. **Food** - Must bring from Earth or grow in habitats

### Moon-Specific Crafting

| Item | Materials | Purpose |
|------|-----------|---------|
| **Insulated Suit Upgrade** | 5 Polymer, 3 Gold | Survive temperature extremes |
| **Extended O2 Tank** | 3 Titanium, 2 Polymer | 30 minute air supply |
| **Lunar Boots** | 2 Titanium, 2 Rubber | Better traction on regolith |

| **Regolith Bricks** | 4 Regolith, 1 Solar heat | Building material |

### Base Building Tips
- Build in lava tubes for natural radiation/temperature protection
- Always have backup power (RTG for night cycle)
- Connect habitats with airlocks
- Keep spare suit near entrance
- Stockpile water ice before it sublimates
