# FARMING

## Basics

### Requirements
1. **Tilled Soil** - Use hoe on dirt
2. **Seeds** - Obtained from plants, animals, or trading
3. **Water** - Nearby water source or irrigation
4. **Light** - Sunlight or artificial grow lights
5. **Time** - Crops take real-time to grow

### Growth Stages
1. **Planted** - Just a patch of soil
2. **Sprouting** - Small green shoots
3. **Growing** - Half-sized plant
4. **Mature** - Full size, not ready
5. **Harvest Ready** - Produces drops

### Factors Affecting Growth

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Water | Required. No water = plant dies |
| Light | Required. No light = slow/no growth |
| Fertilizer | 50% faster growth |
| Rain | Auto-waters outdoor crops |
| Temperature | Too hot/cold = damage |
| Biome | Some crops prefer certain biomes |
