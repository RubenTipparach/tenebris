## Early Game Progression

1. **Find a tree** - Punch it to harvest
2. **Collect logs and sticks** from the trunk
3. **Craft Wood Planks** (1 Log → 4 Planks)
4. **Craft more Sticks** if needed (2 Planks → 4 Sticks)
5. **Mine Coal Ore** underground (depth 12-20)
6. **Smelt Coal Ore** into Coal (1 Ore → 8 Coal)
7. **Craft Torches** (1 Stick + 1 Coal → 4 Torches)
8. **Explore caves** with torches for light!
