# Mars - The Red Frontier

## Overview
Mars is a rusty red desert world with a thin atmosphere, ancient dried riverbeds, and mysterious ruins. While hostile to unprotected humans, it harbors surprising secrets - including strange life forms that have adapted to the harsh conditions.

**Radius:** 55 units
**Gravity:** 0.38x (floaty jumps)
**Atmosphere:** Thin CO2 (suit required, but pressure suit sufficient)
**Day/Night Cycle:** Yes (similar to Earth - 24.6 hours)
**Water:** Subsurface ice, frozen poles

---

## Environment

### Hazards
- **Thin Atmosphere:** Pressure suit required (less strict than Moon)
- **Dust Storms:** Periodic planet-wide storms reduce visibility to zero
- **Radiation:** No magnetic field = solar radiation exposure
- **Cold:** Average -60°C, colder at night and poles
- **Dust Devils:** Localized spinning columns that can knock you over

### Benefits
- **Some Atmosphere:** Partial protection, suits last longer
- **Ice Available:** Easier water access than Moon
- **Lower Gravity:** Easier movement, reduced fall damage
- **Ancient Infrastructure:** Mysterious ruins provide shelter

## Terrain Features

### Rust Deserts
- Endless orange-red sand and rock
- Iron oxide everywhere (free iron!)
- Scattered boulders
- Where dust storms originate

### Valles Marineris (The Great Canyon)
- Massive canyon system

- Seasonal expansion/contraction
- Rich water source
- Polar creatures live here

### Dried Riverbeds
- Ancient water channels
- Smooth polished stones
- Occasional clay deposits
- Fossils?

### Ancient Ruins
- Mysterious pre-human structures
- Advanced technology fragments
- Who built these?
- Some still have power...
